Hello! I'm Archita, a strategy and analytics professional with 3+ years in consulting, now diving deeper into the world of data science and automation.

I'm currently pursuing my Master of Science in Business Analytics at the Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota. Prior to this, I worked at EY-Parthenon where I helped healthcare clients solve operational and strategic challenges, from optimizing diagnostic supply chains to supporting $1B+ investment decisions with doctor benchmarking and patient migration analyses.

Now, I’m expanding that foundation with hands-on experience in NLP, predictive modeling, and statistical modeling, building end-to-end solutions that turn data into insights and impact.
